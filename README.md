Fictitious basketball league for school project

Stack: HTML, CSS, jQuery

This was the first full website that I made. It was my final project for my HTML class. I was also taking a JavaScript 
class that focused on jQuery that semester so I included some scripts in the project.

The site is completely unresponsive and will completely break on smaller screens. Since it was an intro class, 
the instructor didn't spend much time on responsiveness and media queries. The main focus was to simply make a website.

Links are only active for the Providence Roosters. As long as I was able to show that all pages for one team were complete and operational, 
my instructor didn't require the other teams to have pages since it would really just be copying and pasting for the other team sites.

Since this site was never meant for production and was for a project only, the players, player images, and stats are taken from the 2019 Providence College basketball team.
